##Acknowledgments##
Firstly I'd like thank my daughter. Her homework motivated me to write these codes, initially just for offer her more opportunity for some math exercises.

During the programming, more and more I become fascinated with the user-friendly style and high efficiency of Python 3 and PyQt5. Now I think it necessary for a greeting towards the programmers of Python and Qt for all their efforts to these fundamental supports. Of course, here I used the community  version of Pycharm for most of the coding work, nice IDE anyway. People of Pycharm deserve my thanks.
